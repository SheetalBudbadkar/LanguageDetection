# LanguageDetection
This repository contains a language detection that identifies the language of a given text. It uses a machine learning model trained on a diverse set of text samples to accurately classify the language of input data.

**Overview**

**Features**
**Accurate Language Detection** : Identifies the language of a given text from a wide range of supported languages.
**BERT Model** : Uses the bert-base-multilingual-uncased model from Hugging Face for high performance.
**Visualization** : Includes tools for visualizing data distributions and model performance.
**Easy Integration** : Provides a simple interface for integrating language detection into your applications.

**Datasets (Available in Repository)**
train,csv, 
valid.csv, 
and test.csv datasets 

**Run the language detection script**
Open the Language_Detection.ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter and execute the cells to train and evaluate the model.
Predicting Language for a New Text
Use the trained model to predict the language of new text inputs by utilizing the provided prediction pipeline.

**Visualization**
The repository includes code to visualize the distribution of languages in the dataset and the performance of the model through confusion matrices and classification reports.
